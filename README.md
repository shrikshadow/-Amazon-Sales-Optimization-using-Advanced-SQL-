- **Query**: Total revenue generated by each product category.
- **Challenge**: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.

### 3. Average Order Value (AOV)
- **Query**: Compute the average order value for each customer.
- **Challenge**: Include only customers with more than 5 orders.

### 4. Monthly Sales Trend
- **Query**: Monthly total sales over the past year.
- **Challenge**: Display the sales trend, grouping by month, return current_month sale, last month sale.

### 5. Customers with No Purchases
- **Query**: Find customers who have registered but never placed an order.
- **Challenge**: List customer details and the time since their registration.

### 6. Least-Selling Categories by State
- **Query**: Identify the least-selling product category for each state.
- **Challenge**: Include the total sales for that category within each state.

### 7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
- **Query**: Calculate the total value of orders placed by each customer over their lifetime.
- **Challenge**: Rank customers based on their CLTV.

### 8. Inventory Stock Alerts
- **Query**: Products with stock levels below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 10 units).
- **Challenge**: Include last restock date and warehouse information.

### 9. Shipping Delays
- **Query**: Identify orders where the shipping date is later than 3 days after the order date.
- **Challenge**: Include customer, order details, and delivery provider.

### 10. Payment Success Rate
- **Query**: Calculate the percentage of successful payments across all orders.
- **Challenge**: Include breakdowns by payment status (e.g., failed, pending).

### 11. Top Performing Sellers
- **Query**: Find the top 5 sellers based on total sales value.
- **Challenge**: Include both successful and failed orders, and display their percentage of successful orders.

### 12. Product Profit Margin
- **Query**: Calculate the profit margin for each product (difference between price and cost of goods sold).
- **Challenge**: Rank products by their profit margin, showing highest to lowest.

### 13. Most Returned Products
- **Query**: Top 10 products by the number of returns.
- **Challenge**: Display the return rate as a percentage of total units sold for each product.

### 14. Orders Pending Shipment
- **Query**: Find orders that have been paid but are still pending shipment.
- **Challenge**: Include order details, payment date, and customer information.

### 15. Inactive Sellers
- **Query**: Identify sellers who haven’t made any sales in the last 6 months.
- **Challenge**: Show the last sale date and total sales from those sellers.

### 16. Identify Returning or New Customers
- **Query**: Categorize customers as returning or new based on their return behavior.
- **Challenge**: List customer ID, name, total orders, and total returns.

### 17. Cross-Sell Opportunities
- **Query**: Find customers who purchased product A but not product B.
- **Challenge**: Suggest cross-sell opportunities by displaying matching product categories.

### 18. Top 5 Customers by Orders in Each State
- **Query**: Identify the top 5 customers with the highest number of orders for each state.
- **Challenge**: Include the number of orders and total sales for each customer.

### 19. Revenue by Shipping Provider
- **Query**: Calculate the total revenue handled by each shipping provider.
- **Challenge**: Include the total number of orders handled and the average delivery time for each provider.

### 20. Top 10 Products with Highest Decreasing Revenue Ratio
- **Query**: Identify the top 10 products with the highest decreasing revenue ratio compared to last year.
- **Challenge**: Return product ID, product name, category name, 2022 revenue, and 2023 revenue decrease ratio.

### Final Task: Store Procedure
- **Task**: Create a function to reduce inventory quantity as soon as a product is sold.
- **Challenge**: Update the stock in the inventory table based on the product and quantity purchased.

## Skills Used:
- **Programming**: SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Querying, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering
- **Business Intelligence**: Sales Optimization, Inventory Management, Customer Segmentation

# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

### **Difficulty Level: Advanced**

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.


## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

---


## **Learning Outcomes**

This project enabled me to:
- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, and joins.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

---

## **Conclusion**

This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problems using structured queries. From improving customer retention to optimizing inventory and logistics, the project provides valuable insights into operational challenges and solutions.

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can be used to tackle complex data problems and drive business decision-making.
